# Terminal-Website
Personal Website, styled as a computer terminal.

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by my latest OS Course and is also my first website project! During that OS course, I spent a huge amount of time in the terminal; whether that was ssh-ing into a remote server or using bash commands. So, I've grown quite fond of the 'terminal asthetic'!

## What Did I Learn
While building this project, I had the wonderful opertunity to learn more about html, css and js as a whole; learning how to interact with html elements using js, learning how to style individual classes, etc. And, while I do regret not being able to do more with css (using grid/flex-box, etc), stay tuned for future projects where I'll attempt this! ðŸ˜‰

## Challenges
The main challenge in this project was translating the design that I had in my head onto html/css. I have had experience with Java AWT and Scenebuilder before, so luckily designing in html/css wasn't too foreign! I also haven't used lamda functions in a project before, so this was definitely a good oppertunity to work with them!

## Future Updates?
This project may look complete but, there are many more updates I'd like to make to it! In the future I'd like to:
- Add certain Asynchronous Functions functionality
- Add auto scroll
- ~~Add text highlighting on links when hovering~~
- ~~Add 'email' command~~
- Add 'temperature' command
- Optimize text-field focussing
